Volleyball balls Volleyball shorts Volleyball t-shirts Volleyball shoes Volleyball braces, sleeves and pads Volleyball court Volleyball net and poles Volleyball penalty cards Volleyball balls Volleyballs differ greatly depending on whether they will be used indoors or outdoors. While indoor volleyballs are moulded together, outdoor volleyballs are stitched. Typically, indoor volleyballs are made from leather, whereas outdoor balls will usually be made from a composite material that is resistant to water. Volleyball shorts Volleyball shorts need to be supremely comfortable and allow you to move freely and without restriction. Spandex is a super-stretchable material that is perfect for your shorts and you may also wish to look for shorts that have moisture-wicking material to keep you dry throughout the game.</p>
